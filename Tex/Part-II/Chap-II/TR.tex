% Hot path detection
%===============================================================================

\subsection{Hot path detection}
\label{Subsec:hot-path}

LuaJIT does trace compilation. For that, it needs to detect that a certain
portion of the code gets hot and compile it as a trace. Two types of trace entry
are detected, loops and function. In the VM (See Part \ref{Chapt:VM}) each
traceable loop-like or call-like BC (bytecode) decrement a low-overhead profile
counter that is at the hashed PC (program counter) position of a 64-entries table.
When the counter underflows, it starts recording. Below is the call order that
triggers a recording depending on the bytecode. This counter table being small
and collision being ignored, false positive may occur.
It must be noted that LuaJIT perform a natural-loop first (NLF) region selection.
This can be noted in two ways. First, when the BC is a loop the counters are
decremented twice as fast as for function call. Second, in most cases, if a
parent trace hit an inner loop, the parent trace is aborted.

\paratitle{Loops:}

\begin{itemize}
	\item \emph{hotloop} : hash the pc, decrement the corresponding counter and
jmp to vm\_hotloop if it underflows (vm\_(arch).dasc).
	\item \emph{vm\_hotloop} : Prepare the stack and call lj\_trace\_hot.
	\item \emph{lj\_trace\_hot} : start recording a trace (lj\_trace.c).
\end{itemize}

\paratitle{Functions:}

\begin{itemize}
	\item \emph{hotcall} : hash the pc, decrement the corresponding counter and
jmp to vm\_hotcall if it underflows (vm\_(arch).dasc).
	\item \emph{vm\_hotcall} : Prepare the stack and call lj\_dispatch\_call.
	\item \emph{lj\_dispatch\_call} : perform initialization
	and call \emph{lj\_trace\_hot} that start recording a trace (lj\_dispatch.c).
\end{itemize}

\emph{lj\_trace\_hot} start the recording of a parent trace by changing
\emph{J$->$state} to \emph{LJ\_TRACE\_START}, starting the recorder state
machine, described in the next section.

% Recorder state machine
%===============================================================================

\subsection{Recorder state machine}
\label{Subsec:recorder-state-machine}

Recording is the fact of executing the bytecode while remembering dynamic
data/type and generating on the fly the IR specialized for this recording. In
doing so, the control flow is flattened meaning that only taken branch are
recorded and function calls are inlined. The code responsible for that lie in, the
\emph{lj\_trace.c} file for the state machine presented below and the helper
functions, the \emph{lj\_record.c} for most of the bytecode recording,
the \emph{lj\_ffrecord.c} for the data of fast function call and
\emph{lj\_crecord.c} for the cdata operations.

% Abortion and blacklisting
%===============================================================================

\subsection{Abortion and blacklisting}
\label{Subsec:abort}

There exist multiple reason that might cause a recording to abort. Such reason
could be that the unroll limit is reached, that the trace is too long, that the
jit is disabled for a specific function or many others. (see \emph{lj\_traceerr.h}
for the list of possible abort messages). To trigger an abortion, a lua error is
thrown during the recording which transition the recorder state machine to the
\emph{LJ\_TRACE\_ERR} state. Then, the \emph{penalty\_pc} function is called on
the hot bytecode that triggered the recording. The penalty mechanism consists of
a 64-entry table, where each entry is a structure containing the exact PC of the
penalized bytecode, the penalty value, and the reason of the abortion. The
\emph{penaltyslot} variable is a round-robin index inside the table indicating
the next entry to use if a new bytecode needs to be penalized. It as to be noted
that on the contrary of the hotcount mechanism, here the full PC is used to
identify a slot making it free of false positive. However, since the entry is
only 64 entry, penalized bytecode can easily be forgotten in a big code base.
If the penalty for a given bytecode exceeds a threshold then the hot bytecode
responsible for starting the recording gets blacklisted. It means that this
bytecode can never become hot again to start a recording and that if this
bytecode try to be recorded inside another trace, this trace get aborted too
(in most cases). A blacklisted bytecode is never whitelisted by the system.

% Intermediate representation
%===============================================================================

\subsection{Intermediate representation}
\label{Subsec:IR}

LuaJIT use a single high-level intermediate representation (IR) across all
optimization stage. As stated, it is generated on the fly during recording and
it is SSA based (static single assignment). It is implemented with a
bidirectional growable array in memory. It includes two different things:
instructions and constants. Instructions are stored at positive indices, while
constants are stored at negative indices. IR references are 16-bits index inside
the IR array and are biased by adding 0x8000 (negative indices are $<$ 0x8000).
All constants are interned and can be compared for equality only by looking at
their references, simplifying many optimization algorithm. Every instruction has
an output data type. Since the Control-flow is flattened, it is always implicit.
Data-flow for loops is represented using PHI-instructions. Other types of
control-flows are managed using guarded instructions. If a guarded instruction
succeeds the normal execution proceed, otherwise the trace is exited. Those
instructions have two purposes, they are generated by the backend to represent
lua branching code and they are used as assertions on operands to test the
validity of assumptions made during recording. If a trace exit is taken the VM
states are restored using the last snapshot (See Section \ref{Subsec:snap}). If a trace exit is taken a
sufficient number of times, a child trace is recorded
(trace starting from the exit of a parent trace). Remember that side traces are
not recursive (a side trace cannot have a side trace). The IR is threaded with
segregated, per-opcode skip-list chains. The links are stored in the \emph{prev}
field in the instruction (see Table below). This facilitates low-overhead
lookup for many IR optimizations (i.e. CSE, DSE and alias analysis).

% Snapshots
%===============================================================================

\subsection{Snapshots}
\label{Subsec:snap}

Snapshot is an important mechanism used in trace compilation. The VM should
always be in a consistent state, meaning that all updates should respect the
original language semantics. However, to perform some trace optimization
(e.g. sinking optimization \ref{Subsec:opt-sinking}) this consistency is not respected. Instead
modification that should have occurred during a trace is recorded inside the
snapshots and those modifications are replayed at trace exit. The Snapshot
mechanism is implemented in the snap.[hc] files, and you can find the
\emph{SnapShot} data-structure in lj\_jit.h. For details about
Snapshot usages and implementation refer to section of the wiki on sinking
optimization \cite{luajit-sink} and a mail on the subject \cite{luajit-mail-1}.
