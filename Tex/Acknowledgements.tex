Firstly, I would like to express my sincere gratitude to my supervisor at CERN,
Laurent Deniau for the daily support during this entire project. I truly learned
a lot from this collaboration and It opened my interested in new subjects.

Then, I would like to thank Prof. Martin Odersky to have accepted to be my EPFL
supervisor allowing me to pursue my work at CERN.

Finally, I would like to thank Mike Pall for his commitment to the LuaJIT project
from which I learned many things.
