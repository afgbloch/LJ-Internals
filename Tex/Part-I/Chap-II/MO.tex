When looking at the timing of individual tests of the MAD test suite we can see
that most of the instability comes from the Model Object tests. In Figure
\ref{fig:failed-test}, we can see a screenshot of three failed timing tests that
were calibrated to run in roughly 0.5 seconds and that for this run needed respectively
6, 4 and 68 seconds. We need then to investigate the reason for such results.

The Lua programming language doesn't actually have an object model but provide
mechanisms that allow anyone to build a custom object model fitting his needs.
Next section will present the one that as been built for MAD.
