Most a the VM mechanism is written using the DynASM syntax. To get a better
understanding of the underlining technology see Appendix \ref{Apendix:DynASM}.

The low-level VM code written for each architecture using this assembler can be
found in \emph{vm\_(target).dasc} files. It is mainly composed of the switch
case that generate the assembly code for each byte code, but it also contains
code for other part that requires low level implementation such as the
stack unwinding or the implementation of the fast path of asm fast library functions
(see section \ref{Sec:ffunc} for more).
